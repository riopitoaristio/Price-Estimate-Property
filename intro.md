Predicting Property Prices step-by-step!

Curious about the secrets behind accurate property price predictions?

In my latest project, I embarked on an exhilarating journey of analyzing and exploring the housing market in Boston, armed with Python as my trusty tool.

Here's how I tackled the challenge:

1. Data Analysis and Exploration: I delved deep into the dataset, examining the nuances and trends of Boston's housing market.

2. Data Splitting: I carefully divided the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring robust model performance evaluation.

3. Multivariable Regression: Leveraging the power of regression analysis, I built a sophisticated model capable of capturing multiple factors influencing property prices.

4. Coefficient and Residual Model Evaluation: I meticulously assessed the coefficients and residuals of the model to gauge its accuracy and fine-tune its performance.

5. Data Transformation for Enhanced Performance: By applying transformative techniques, I enhanced the model's predictive abilities, boosting its accuracy and reliability.

6. Predicting Property Prices: Finally, I harnessed the potential of this comprehensive model to estimate property prices with precision and confidence.

I must clarify that this project utilized a dummy dataset, providing a foundation for future real-world applications.
